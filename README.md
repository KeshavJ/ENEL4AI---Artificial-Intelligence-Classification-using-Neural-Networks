# ENEL4AI---Artificial-Intelligence-Classification-using-Neural-Networks

The project aims to investigate and implement the different
steps that are needed to design and use Artificial neural
networks to classify images of manufactured items into
groups of good, bad and empty. In particular, a Multi-
Layer Perceptron (MLP) type of Neural Network is used.

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has to be trained
using Haralick features, which is extracted
from the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matric (GLCM) as the core data of the
Neural Network.
